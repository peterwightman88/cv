        <h3><center>South Tyneside Homes – Handy Estates Operative</center></h3>

<p><center>January 2013 – August 2018</center></p><br />

<p><br /> •	For the last four years I have been employed by South Tyneside Homes where my general day to day responsibilities involve various elements of grounds maintenance work such as weeding, grass cutting and hedge trimming. Also, my daily duties include numerous tasks from the environmental service background such as litter picking, emptying bins, clearing faecal matter and the removal of dead animals.
<br /> <br />  •	Acting in a supervisory role to street sweepers and overseeing work quality and verifying satisfactory meeting of company and regulation standards. Organizing workflow and ensure that employees understand their duties or delegated tasks.
<br /> <br />  •	I was expected to work flexibly and outside of normal contracted hours to help mitigate emergencies, such as the effects of adverse weather conditions or large car crashes.
<br /> <br />  •	Receiving and responding to issues raised by general public and responding to them in a timely fashion.
<br /> <br />  •	It has been my responsibility to manage workloads successfully and independently, this also includes when I have been asked to participate in numerous projects on top of my normal work load. For example, last month I had to liaise with the youth recreational team who were helping participate in the general clean-up of the Horsley Hill area. It was my duty to provide any assistance I could to the team by providing tools, supervision and arrange the removal of any waste bags they left behind. The experience of managing different work projects and helping supervise different teams has been personally very fulfilling and I feel would be essential in helping me adjust to a new role should I be successful.
<br /> <br />  •	Working within a close knit team was a daily responsibility and I was expected to liaise between senior management and team members who I was supervising. I was also expected to liaise between senior management and emergency services, different in house teams and external companies. I feel that in performing these duties I have earned essential experience and skills in team working. It was also essential at times for me to work independently and to use my initiate when required.
<br /><br />  •	It was essential for me to diversify my communication for a variety of different people. For example, senior management, staff members I was supervising, external companies and members of the public also.

<h3><center> South Tyneside Council – Market Operations Supervisory Assistant</center> </h3>
<p><center>January 2008 – January 2013</center><br /></p>

<p><br /> •	My central responsibilities at South Tyneside Council were to provide professional customer service to market traders and the general public alike, whilst maintaining and managing the market to a professional standard. Maintenance involved the repairing of wooden boards, replacing damaged parts on condemned stalls and repairing of ripped or torn stall canopies.
<br /> <br /> •	I was also expected to have a competent understanding of numeracy and literacy due to the supervisory aspect of my role, whereby I had to collect stall holder rent money, bank it and then complete various associated admin tasks.
<br /> <br /> •	The experience of working in a close knit team has also allowed me to develop efficient team-working skills. These skills, alongside my communicational abilities are necessary, as on a daily basis there are set amounts of work to be completed, which allowed us to meet daily deadlines. As part of a team, I am responsible for ensuring market construction is complete by the 6am deadline, whilst also ensuring the site is Health and Safety compliant prior to trader arrival.  This process requires a coordinated approach and as such draws upon my effective communication and team working skills to ensure this is completed to a high standard and in an efficient manner.
<br /> <br /> •	Ensuring local policies were followed and legal requirements were consistently met through ensuring all traders have adequate and up to date public liability insurance. This is generally a face to face exchange, although it was also common for me to liaise via email or telephone.
<br /> <br /> •	I was first point of contact on site during market operating hours, for traders and members of the public. This position often required me to mitigate hostile or sensitive situations whether this is solely between traders or between the traders and public. One instance I needed to calm a member of the public down whilst liaising with Trading Standards and the trader in question to find a suitable result.
<br /> <br /> •	I have worked flexibly and outside of usual contracted hours to help mitigate emergencies, such as the effects of adverse weather conditions. An example of this is during an instance last year where I assisted in the filling and distribute of sand bags to the general public to prevent flooding due to extreme rainy conditions.
<br /> <br /> •	I have a depth of knowledge and leadership skills such that I was previously entrusted with coordinating and supervising a team of four agency staff on Great North Run day. My task was to guide my team as to council protocol and to efficiently direct them to assist in making sure the course was both safe and clean for runners.
<br /> <br /> •	I am constantly looking to further myself whether it be in education, general knowledge or self preservation and my time with South Tyneside Council has been no different, during this employment I  have took part and completed a first aid course as well numerous other work related courses.
